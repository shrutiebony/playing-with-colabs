# Play with colabs and python and ai pair programmer. Use akkio.com or any other zero code ai platforms to do ml projec 

**Assignment 1:**
Go thru the two demo youtube videos of colabs discussed in the class
Implement all the code of derek banas python tutorial in colab and run and show
Implement the features of advanced colab tutorials in my slides and provide them in a colab.

I have implemented all code which has shown in Derek Banas video and advanved colab tutorials and uploaded the same.

**Assignment2:**
Use  AI Pair Programmer ( either use claudedev (github), or cursor.so (paid) or Github copilot paid - students discount).
You need to provide video of you using github copilot in visual studio code and having it code some interesting projects.
You can add any other coding like backend, frontend and html demos if you want.

I have developed a game Memory Matching Mania using Github Copilot and uploaded the video in youtube.

The below files which I used are uploaded here.
1. app.py
2. index.html

**Assignment3:**
Auto ML with akkio or jadbio or any other good zero code automl - trial version
Get akkio.com freeaccount,  demonstrate one (or more if you are interested)  end2end ml project in jadbio (no code project) 

I have created akkio free account and developed Customer Churn prediction Machine Learning model by using it.
Youtube link: https://youtu.be/jWjwROzuELI

Customer Churn prediction : This project helps us to find which customers will continue doing business which customers don't.
Dataset: I have used kaggle dataset for this project and have many columns like customerID, gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, churn....
The model has splitted the dataset into testing and training automatically and did feature training, selected the best algorithm for the task. The model performance is calculated based on several metrics like accuracy, precision, recall...
It visualizes the data in the form of graphs, charts and all..
The model can deploy our model using API.
